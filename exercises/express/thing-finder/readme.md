The goal of this exercise was to write an express server with a get route that sends back an array of that thing.

The "thing" in this exercise is an array of fruit objects, with the properties of type and color. While this server is running, a user can send a get request with query strings and receive each instance that meets the criteria back as an array of matching objects.
